- Image: Upload a professional photograph (Passport sized: 600 x 600 px or 1200 x 1200 px).

### 3. Lock Candidate Data:

Enhance security by implementing a data lock feature, restricting changes to candidate data. Authorized personnel can temporarily disable the lock for necessary modifications, ensuring consistency and protection.

Note: In order to proceed further in the election process, the data lock option must be enabled. When the data lock is enabled, some options related to candidate may be restricted or unavailable.

### 7. Generate Result:
Access the Generate Result option to obtain the final outcome. For additional voting, regenerate results to include updated data.

Note:Updating Results with Additional Voting:
If additional voting is conducted after the initial result generation, it is important to generate the results again to reflect the updated data accurately. This ensures that the final results include all the votes cast throughout the entire election process.

- In the settings page, find the option to manage or create a new election.

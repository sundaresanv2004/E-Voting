# Welcome to E-Voting App! version-6.08

Experience the ease and security of our advanced election application, designed to simplify and enhance your participation in the democratic process. We prioritize your security, privacy, and the transparency of every vote cast. Here's a comprehensive guide to ensure a smooth and secure election process:

## Firebase Connection

Each Firebase project serves as a dedicated repository for a single election dataset. Begin the process of creating a new election by initiating a new project in Firebase. Then, ensure seamless connectivity to additional databases by navigating to the settings menu.

## Conducting an Election:

### 1. Add Candidates:

In the `Candidate Page`, use the `Add Candidate` option to create candidate profiles with essential information:

- Full Name: Enter the candidate's full name.
- Position: Specify the role or position.
- Image: Upload a professional photograph (Passport-sized: 600 x 600 px or 1200 x 1200 px).

### 2. Final Nomination List:

Generate the final list of candidates in the Election Page. Arrange positions based on significance for voter presentation.

Note: Once the nomination list is generated, no changes can be made to the candidate data such as adding new data, editing, or deleting data. Ensure all candidate information is correct before generating the nomination list.

### 3. Enable Voting:

Enable the election through the Vote option. Certain options may be restricted post-election for security reasons.

Note: After the election has been conducted, certain options within the election page may be inaccessible for security reasons.

### 4. View Results:

To view the election results, go to the Election Page and click on View Result to summarize the results. Click on a result summary for a detailed breakdown.

### 5. Add Another Device:
To connect another device, upload the same private key generated by Firebase and paste the configuration code. Click on Connect Server and enter your email, password, and the verification code sent to your email. Once this is done, your app will be successfully connected to the existing Firebase project.

The Add Another Device option can be accessed on the first page at the right corner under Manage Service or after logging in on the Settings page under Manage Connections.

## Creating a New Election:
Maintain a clear distinction between elections with the option to create a new one:

- In the settings page, find the option to manage or create a new election.
- Click on New Election to initiate the creation of a fresh and independent election.
- Upload the new Firebase project key to connect with Firebase.
- Select the newly created election as the Current Election to focus on its actions and data.

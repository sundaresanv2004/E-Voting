We're unable to connect to Firebase due to a missing file or invaled file.

To proceed, please upload the private key generated by your Firebase project. If you don't have a Firebase project yet, kindly follow these steps to create one:


## Create Firebase Project

We're utilizing Firebase as our data storage solution. To establish the connection to Firebase, simply follow these steps:

__Database and storage management will be seamlessly handled by our program. Users only need to set up access to the database, storage, and authentication to access full functionality.__


1. Set Up a Firebase Account and Log In
   - Create an Account: Visit the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
   - Log In: Access your Firebase account by logging in with your credentials.


2. Create a New Project
   - Access the Console: Once logged in, navigate to the Firebase console.
   - Create Project: Click on 'Add project', then enter a custom name for your project that reflects your application's identity.


3. Set Up Authentication
   - Navigate to Authentication: In the Firebase console, select the 'Authentication' tab and then click on the 'Get started' button.
   - Enable Email/Password: Under the 'Sign-in method' tab, find the 'Email/Password' sign-in provider and enable it. This will allow your users to register and authenticate using their email addresses and passwords.


4. Initialize Firestore Database
   - Create Firestore Database: Go to the 'Database' section in the Firebase console and click on 'Create database'.
   - Set Security Rules: Choose 'Start in production mode' to set up Firestore with initial security rules that restrict data access to authorized users.
   - Complete Initialization: Follow the prompts to select your database's location and finalize its setup.


5. Set Up Firebase Storage
   - Initialize Storage: Navigate to the 'Storage' section in the Firebase console and click on 'Get started'.
   - Create Storage Instance: Click on 'Create storage' to provision cloud storage for your application, which is essential for handling file uploads securely.


6. Generate a New Private Key
   - Access Project Settings: Go back to the main dashboard of the Firebase console and select the 'Project settings'.
   - Service Account Tab: Click on the 'Service accounts' tab.
   - Download Private Key: Click on 'Generate new private key', then confirm the action to download the key, which will be stored in your default download folder.


7. Run Your E-Voting Application
   - Launch Application: Start your e-voting application. It should prompt you to upload the private key you downloaded.
   - Upload Key: Locate and select the key file from your download folder to authenticate and connect your application to Firebase.


Note: Each Firebase project serves as a dedicated repository for a single election dataset. Begin the process of creating a new election by initiating a new project in Firebase. Then, ensure seamless connectivity to additional databases by navigating to the settings menu and following the above steps once more to create a project.
